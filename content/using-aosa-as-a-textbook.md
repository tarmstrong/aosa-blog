Title: Using AOSA as a Textbook

One of the reasons we started this project is that almost every other
book on software architecture doesn't actually show readers the
architectures of any actual systems. In particular, most university
students can get through a four-year degree without ever seeing how
large applications are put together. We're therefore very excited to
learn that Dr. Neil Ernst is using AOSA in an undergrad course he's
teaching at the University of British Columbia. If you'd like to see
what his students think of the systems we've described, [their
presentations are online][]. And if you know of anyone else doing this,
please send us a pointer.
