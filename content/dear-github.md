Dear GitHub,

You provide a wonderful workspace where millions of people can share
what they make, but there's something you could do to make yourself even
better. Could you please provide a way for us to create plug
applications directly into your site the way Facebook does? Thousands of
really cool software tools are just waiting to be discovered, from code
analyzers to project history visualizers, and while your APIs already
let them use your data on their own web sites, people would be much more
likely to find them and use them if they were nested directly in
projects' GitHub pages. It wouldn't be much of a technological
challenge—given the way Facebook's stock has been doing, you could
probably even persuade one or two of their engineers to come and help
build it—and it would kickstart the same healthy explosion of
third-party tools we saw when Eclipse first came on the scene.

Thanks very much,

Us.

p.s. If you like this idea, please tweet the following:
