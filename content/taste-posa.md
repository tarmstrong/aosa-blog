A few weeks ago Greg [posted][] about the next book we're doing: *The
Performance of Open Source Applications*. Well, we don't have a book
yet, but we've made some progress. Earlier this week we had our 15th
"yes" from an author, which puts us close to the chapter counts of
[AOSA][]. We're excited about that and we hope you are too. Here are a
couple of the chapters we're planning:

</p>

-   Jessica McKellar on Twisted [again][], getting into the details of
    asynchronous I/O.
-   Audrey Tang on profiling and optimizing [Ethercalc][], a Google
    Docs-esque spreadsheet application written in node.js.
-   Kyle Huey on Mozilla's [Memshrink][] project, which aims to make
    Firefox faster and "slimmer".
-   Rosangela Canino-Koning and Eric McDonald on processing terabytes of
    data in the [Khmer project][], which is a "library and toolkit for
    doing k-mer-based dataset analysis and transformations".

</p>

Remember, if you want to see your favourite Open Source Application
discussed in the new book, we're accepting contributions. If you're
interested, please get in touch at <posabook@gmail.com>. If you don't
want to write a chapter yourself, why not send someone our way?
