I'm happy to announce that *The Performance of Open Source Applications* is finally out.
You can read it on our
[main site](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) or 
buy a paper copy from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop/tavish-armstrong/the-performance-of-open-source-applications/paperback/product-21241242.html) for US$25.00.
As with the previous two books, all royalties go to Amnesty International.

Thank you to everyone who contributed, and everyone who cheered us on.
I hope you learn as much from the authors as I did.
